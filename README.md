Hey,

Welcome to our dashboard :)

Our dashboard offers a forecast of CO2 emissions per kWh for the electricity grid in Denmark for the year 2022, utilizing weather data. 
Denmark's electricity grid has two different price areas, each with its own CO2 emission levels, shown on the map.
To explore the forecasted emissions, simply click on a price area and choose from one of the four available predictionÂ models.
