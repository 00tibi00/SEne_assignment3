Hey,

Welcome to our dashboard :)

Our dashboard offers a forecast of CO2 emissions per kWh for the electricity grid in Denmark for the year 2022, utilizing weather data. 
Denmark's electricity grid has two different price areas, each with its own CO2 emission levels, shown on the map.
To explore the forecasted emissions, simply click on a price area and choose from one of the four available prediction models.

This Project was done by Thibaud Didier van Eupen and Katharina Zimmer.
We did the forecast of the CO2 emissions for two price areas in denmark.
Thibaud Didier van Eupen did the dashboard and Katharina Zimmer did the code for the regression models including feature selection and data collection.
